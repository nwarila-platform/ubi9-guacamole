Usage: tests/runtime-hardening.sh <image-ref> [expected-entrypoint]

Inspect a built downstream UBI 9 (ubi-micro) image for the template's runtime
hardening baseline: non-root user; no shell; no dnf/microdnf/rpm/yum; no curl
or wget; the rpm database PRESENT (so scanners enumerate packages); the RHEL CA
bundle populated at /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt; no setuid and no
world-writable-without-sticky paths; and the expected entrypoint.

expected-entrypoint defaults to /usr/local/bin/app; image repos pass their own
(e.g. /usr/local/bin/vault).

The image filesystem is inspected from `docker export` without extracting it
(tar -tvf for the manifest + permissions, tar -xOf for single-file contents) so
the check is identical on Linux CI runners and developer workstations and never
depends on the host's ability to recreate the rootfs's symlinks/devices.
