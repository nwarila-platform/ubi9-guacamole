# Publish A Derived Image

Use this pattern in downstream image repositories once the manifest points at
real application inputs and a registry destination exists. Keep the local
`make image` flow for fast runtime checks; use the publish flow for digest
evidence.

## Release Contract

The release job should:

1. Verify the audited SLSA generator tag still resolves to the reviewed commit.
2. Build application artifacts and verify their SHA256 values against the
   reviewed manifest.
3. Build and push the image by digest with BuildKit SBOM and provenance
   enabled. Because the runtime rootfs keeps the rpm database at
   `/var/lib/rpm`, the SBOM and scanners see every installed package.
4. Sign the pushed digest with Cosign/Sigstore keyless, using `--recursive`
   so attached SBOM and attestation manifests are signed too.
5. Scan and compliance-check the pushed digest: OpenSCAP against the RHEL 9
   STIG profile, plus Trivy and Grype.
6. Run runtime hardening against the same digest, not a mutable tag.
7. Call the SLSA container generator with the image name and digest so it writes
   a cosign OCI provenance attestation from the trusted reusable workflow.

Docker's local `--load` exporter is not an evidence path. It is useful for
runtime tests, but it does not preserve image attestations in the Docker image
store. Use a registry push for release evidence, or the local/tar exporter when
you are validating SBOM files before a push.

## Workflow Skeleton

Pin every ordinary `uses:` value to a reviewed commit SHA before enabling this
in a real repository. The SLSA generator reusable is the exception: keep it on
the semantic-version tag shown below and keep the tag-integrity guard beside it.
The version comments on SHA-pinned actions are orientation labels, not pins.

This skeleton reflects the inherited workflow as it is retained in this
repository while publishing is disabled pending replacement by the redesigned
pipeline. Its only trigger is manual dispatch. A dispatch runs the tag-integrity
job, but the publish job is skipped because it still requires a `push` event.

## Review Rules

- Do not pass secrets as Docker build args. BuildKit max provenance can expose
  build argument values.
- Attest and sign `image@sha256:...`, not a mutable tag.
- Keep registry credentials in GitHub Actions secrets or OIDC-backed registry
  auth, not in the manifest.
- For vendor release binaries, verify upstream checksum signatures or Sigstore
  bundles before writing the artifact SHA256 into the manifest.
- If you need an SBOM file before pushing, build with
  `docker buildx build --sbom=true --output type=local,dest=dist/evidence .`
  and inspect `dist/evidence/sbom.spdx.json`.

## Verification

When an operational release pipeline publishes an image, verify the evidence
from a clean checkout with the exact SLSA generator identity. The reference
contract is kept in
[`../reference/slsa-l3-provenance.md`](../reference/slsa-l3-provenance.md).

```sh
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance <image>@<digest> \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_container_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v2.1.0 \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

```sh
slsa-verifier verify-image <image>@<digest> \
  --source-uri github.com/NWarila/ubi9-application-template \
  --builder-id https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/.github/workflows/generator_container_slsa3.yml@refs/tags/v2.1.0
```
